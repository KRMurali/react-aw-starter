## What is an Adaptive Web Application?
An Adaptive web application, as opposed to a responsive web application use separate UI templates for different devices the user may use to access the application from. Adaptive web applications is not a new thing, I am sure you will remember the mobile domains (m.domain.com) to which the user will be redirected whenever he/she visited the site in a mobile device. Having a separate mobile site is also a form of an Adaptive Application, but it is not optimal as it comes along with its own problems like infrastructure, separate domain names etc.,

With an adaptive setup, you can render different template and content to different devices. The devices included can be Desktop, Mobile, Tablets, TV Devices and Bots.
